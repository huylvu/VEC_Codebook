# Introduction {#intro}

## Overview in line with the VEC Guidelines {#overview}

The Viet Nam Enterprise Census is a nationwide census conducted annually. It collects detailed information on enterprises and cooperatives (including unions of cooperatives) in order to:

- support evidence-based management, policy design and evaluation, and the compilation of GDP/GRDP and other indicators in the System of National Accounts;

- produce official publications such as the Enterprise White Book and the Cooperative White Book, and to update the business register used as a sampling frame for other statistical surveys;

- meet users’ information needs while strictly respecting confidentiality under the Statistics Law and avoiding overlap with other statistical operations.

Key design features that are relevant for this codebook include:

- **Geographical coverage**: all 63 provinces and centrally governed cities.

- **Industry coverage**: all VSIC 2018 sections, except for sections O, T and U.

- **Observation unit**: local establishments of enterprises and cooperatives, including independent-accounting branches where applicable.

- **Identification and classification**: tax code or enterprise code, administrative location (province, district, commune), detailed address, VSIC industry, ownership type, and branch information.

- **Reference period**: the financial year immediately preceding the survey date, with the survey implemented annually according to the plan of the General Statistics Office.

## Data structure {#data-structure}

According to the VEC Guidelines, there are more than 30 questionaires that design for multi purpose, some of them are used for the main survey, some of them are used for the sample survey. For this codebook, we focus on the main survey, which is **Questionnaire 01**.

**Questionnaire 01** (for enterprises) is the core instrument of the survey, and it also provides the main microdata that we process in this codebook. Variables are organised into blocks that mirror the content structure of Questionnaire 01:

| Content block (Questionnaire 01) | Typical components |
|:---------------------------------|:-------------------|
| **Identification & location** | Tax identification number<br>Enterprise code<br>Province/District/Commune<br>Detailed address<br>Ownership type<br>VSIC industry |
| **General information** | Year of establishment<br>Operating status<br>Location inside/outside industrial or economic zones<br>Type of zone<br>Main and secondary economic activities |
| **Employment & labour costs** | Employment at the beginning and end of the year<br>Female employees<br>Total wage bill, social insurance contributions, and other labour-related expenses |
| **Production and business results** | Turnover/net revenue<br>Cost of goods sold<br>Profit before tax<br>Corporate income tax |
| **Assets and liabilities** | Total assets at the beginning and end of the year<br>Current and non-current assets<br>Fixed assets (at historical cost) and depreciation<br>Work-in-progress construction<br>Total liabilities<br>Owners’ equity |
| **Taxes and budget payments** | Other payments to the State budget, as specified in the questionnaire |
| **External trade and technology** | Export and import status<br>Relevant international trade activities and technology-related information |

Data is collected at the enterprise or independent-branch level, with unique identifiers allowing longitudinal analysis across years. All variables, definitions, and coding rules are presented in the following chapters and are aligned with the content structure and interpretation in the VEC Guidelines for Questionnaire 01.

In this codebook, we **focus primarily on the dataset derived from Questionnaire 01**, which is the main target of our analysis. The table above summarises the **data structure** that we use; other questionnaires are only referenced when they are needed for consistency checks or for additional contextual information.
