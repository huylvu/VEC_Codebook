- 🔍 **Research Applications:** Examples of using cleaned VEC data for economic analysis

## What is this codebook? {-}

This codebook provides comprehensive documentation for the **Vietnam Enterprise Census (VEC)** dataset harmonization and cleaning process. The VEC is an annual comprehensive statistical survey conducted by Vietnam's General Statistics Office (GSO) to collect detailed information about enterprises and cooperatives nationwide. The VEC survey serves multiple critical purposes:

**Economic Policy & Planning:**

- Support economic management, evaluation, and forecasting
- Provide data for GDP calculation and provincial GRDP estimation
- Contribute to national economic development policies and plans

**Statistical Products:**

- Produce the "White Book of Enterprises 2025" (Sách trắng doanh nghiệp 2025)
- Generate comprehensive business statistics and indicators
- Update sampling frames for future enterprise surveys

**Sector-Specific Analysis:**

- Compile agricultural, forestry, and fisheries statistics from enterprise data
- Support sectoral policy development and monitoring

**Data Infrastructure:**

- Maintain updated enterprise database for statistical purposes
- Provide reliable data for government agencies, researchers, and international organizations

**Survey Coverage:**

- **Scope:** All 63 provinces/cities nationwide
- **Target Population:** All formal enterprises and cooperatives (excluding household activities, political organizations, and international bodies)
- **Survey Types:** Complete enumeration + sample survey for detailed indicators
- **Reference Period:** Our codebook covers the harmonization of 22 year of VEC datasets (2000-2021).

This codebook aims to help researchers at DEPOCEN and elsewhere better understand and use the VEC dataset consistently for research and consultancy purposes, while promoting transparency and reproducibility. We believe that sharing this resource with the broader research community can enhance the quality and reliability of studies utilizing VEC data.
